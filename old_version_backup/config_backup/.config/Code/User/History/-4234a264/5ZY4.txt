the plan for this game:

is just going to be a little demo sort of thing about gear shifting

the top half of the screen is just a car driving on the road
car has little animations:
    wheels have different frames to rotate
    will probably make it move up and down a pixel or something

the bottom of the screen is like the dash where you have a gearstick box
    and other stuff like a speedometer

main gameplay is just getting the clutch and shifts and stuff

show movement by having the lines on the road that move
and maybe eventually little things in the background that go by
