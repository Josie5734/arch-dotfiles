All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nFor more information on how to use Multi-Account Containers, visit our help articles:\n\n\nAll about Multi Account Containers\nMulti Container user - how to use Mozilla VPN\nVPN subscriber - how to use Multi Account Containers","weeklyDownloads":10007,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Firefox","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266157.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266157.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266158.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266158.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266160.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266160.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266159.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266159.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.592,"reviewCount":3624,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1764011539000},{"id":"marcoagpinto@mail.telepac.pt","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/461/461570-32.png?modified=cf285b4b","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/461/461570-64.png?modified=cf285b4b","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/461/461570-128.png?modified=cf285b4b"},"name":"British English Dictionary (Marco Pinto)","version":"4.0.4","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4654881/british_english_dictionary_2-4.0.4.xpi","homepageURL":"https://proofingtoolgui.org","supportURL":"https://proofingtoolgui.org","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/british-english-dictionary-2/","description":"A fork of Mark Tyndall's add-on, based on David Bartlett's\nBritish Dictionary R1.19 for Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.","fullDescription":"British English Dictionary V4\nFor Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey\nA carefully maintained, community-driven resource for accurate British English spelling.\n\n\n\n📢 Update\n\nAs of March 2025, this dictionary fully aligns with modern -ise verb spellings (e.g., “organise”).\nFor specific -ise/-ize variants, some verbs and words MAY be missing or included differently.\n\n\n\n🔗 Websites\n\n    https://proofingtoolgui.org (Proofing Tool GUI)\n    https://github.com/marcoagpinto/aoo-mozilla-en-dict (GitHub)\n    https://linkedin.com/in/marcoagpinto (LinkedIn)\n    https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/british-english-dictionary-2 (Firefox add-on)\n    https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/british-english-dictionary-2 (Thunderbird add-on)\n    https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/english-dictionaries (LibreOffice extension) \n\n\n\n\n🌟 Key Features\n\n    145 000+ words added since 2013 (updated to V4)\n    Based primarily on Oxford and Collins dictionaries\n    Covers both modern and literary vocabulary\n    Compatible with Commonwealth/European English variants \n\n\n\n\n🔍 Inclusion Rules\n\n    Words must appear in at least two authoritative sources (e.g., Oxford + Collins) (except proper nouns)\n    Archaic terms included only if they do not conflict with modern usage\n    U.S. spellings are retained when widely adopted in British English (e.g., “movie”) and validated by trusted sources\n        Note: The dictionary's U.S. origins explain why many U.S. words are present.\n\n\n\n\n📥 Installation\n\n    Firefox/Thunderbird 115+ (ESR): Install directly from Mozilla Add-ons\n    Legacy Firefox/Thunderbird (v59 or earlier):\n        Download the .xpi file from GitHub: https://github.com/marcoagpinto/aoo-mozilla-en-dict\n        Drag & drop the downloaded .xpi file into the Extensions/Dictionaries window\n    Enable via right-click in an editable text area: “Languages” → “English (United Kingdom)”\n\n\n📚 Full guide: https://proofingtoolgui.org/en_installing.html\n\n\n\n🛠 Developer Commitment\n\n    15+ years of continuous updates\n    Personally funded (hosting, Oxford Premium access, domains)\n    Open-source collaboration on GitHub\n    Built on the Proofing Tool GUI framework for transparent validation \n\n\n\n\n❓ FAQ Highlights\n\n    Why include “movie”?
